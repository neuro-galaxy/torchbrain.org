Made with React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS

For development:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use `npm run format` to format the code.

To deploy:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
This would build and push the built page onto the `gh-pages` branch, which is what is set to be hosted by GitHub pages.
